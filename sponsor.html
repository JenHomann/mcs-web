      <p>
        While our curriculum is designed challenge the minds of our students,
        there are some puzzles we don‚Äôt want them to have to solve.
        One of our core values has always been accessibility,
        and some of the barriers to getting into code have nothing to do with the code itself:
        lack of access to technology, transportation, or even an empty stomach can stand between
        a potential coder and their ambition to learn.
        We do not charge our students any kind of tuition,
        so it is only through the support of our generous
        sponsors that we are able to continue with our vision.

        Please contact us at <a href="mailto:mysterycodesociety@gmail.com">mysterycodesociety@gmail.com</a> about these sponsorship opportunities.
      </h3>
      <div>
        <h2>Pizza Sponsor</h2>
        <p>Your support will feed our students pizza for 6-12 weeks of class.</p>
        <p>
          While pizza may seem like a perk, providing lunch helps students focus,
          and keeps us accessible for students who might not otherwise be able to take the class.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <h2>Location Sponsor</h2>
        <p>Host our students in your space and on your wifi for 6-12 weeks of class.</p>
        <p>
          (<em>Monetary or donation of space</em>)
          A regular home base that‚Äôs accessible to our students (with reliable wifi!) takes a lot
          of the guesswork out for our organizers (and the parents of our students!)
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <h2>Graduation Sponsor</h2>
        <p>
          Snacks, decorations and awards for our Graduation Celebrations,
          one of the most rewarding days of class for students, their families, and our volunteers.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <h2>Snack Sponsor</h2>
        <p>Light snacks are provided every week.</p>
        <p>Sometimes fruit snacks are just the break you need to fix that bug.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <p>
        All sponsors are featured on our website,
        as well as getting frequent shout outs from the Mystery Code Society social media,
