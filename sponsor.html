      <p>
        While our curriculum is designed challenge the minds of our students,
        there are some puzzles we don’t want them to have to solve.
        One of our core values has always been accessibility,
        and some of the barriers to getting into code have nothing to do with the code itself:
        lack of access to technology, transportation, or even an empty stomach can stand between
        a potential coder and their ambition to learn.
        We do not charge our students any kind of tuition,
        so it is only through the support of our generous
        sponsors that we are able to continue with our vision.

        Please contact us at <a href="mailto:mysterycodesociety@gmail.com">mysterycodesociety@gmail.com</a> about these sponsorship opportunities.
      </h3>
      <div>
        <h2>Pizza Sponsor</h2>
        <p>Your support will feed our students pizza for 6-12 weeks of class.</p>
        <p>
          While pizza may seem like a perk, providing lunch helps students focus,
          and keeps us accessible for students who might not otherwise be able to take the class.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <h2>Location Sponsor</h2>
        <p>Host our students in your space and on your wifi for 6-12 weeks of class.</p>
        <p>
          (<em>Monetary or donation of space</em>)
          A regular home base that’s accessible to our students (with reliable wifi!) takes a lot
          of the guesswork out for our organizers (and the parents of our students!)
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <h2>Graduation Sponsor</h2>
        <p>
          Snacks, decorations and awards for our Graduation Celebrations,
          one of the most rewarding days of class for students, their families, and our volunteers.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <h2>Snack Sponsor</h2>
        <p>Light snacks are provided every week.</p>
        <p>Sometimes fruit snacks are just the break you need to fix that bug.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

      <p>

        We could not done what we have done without the generosity of our sponsors,
        and we will not be able to achieve all we want to achieve without partnering with more sponsors in the future.
        And we do feel our sponsors are partners with us in this mission.
        Sponsors visit our classes, come to our graduations, connect us with community leaders who connect us with more students.

        <h2>Our Location Sponsor:<br><a href="http://omahalibrary.org" target="_blank">Milton R. Abrahams Library</a></h2>
        <p>
          Since the beginning we have partnered with this branch of the Omaha Public Library on 90th and Fort Street.
          They have donated not just the space where we hold their class, but the support of their incredible staff,
          Chrome Books for the students to learn on, and a platform to find new students who may not have heard of us any other way.

			  <h2>Our Pizza Sponsor:<br><a href="http://godynamo.com" target="_blank">Dynamo</a></h2>
			  <p>
			    Dynamo is an Omaha based IT consulting and recruiting firm, and since the very first class they have provided
			    lunch for all our students and teaching assistants.
			    While pizza may seem like a perk, providing lunch helps students focus,
			    and keeps us accessible for students who might not otherwise be able to take the class.

        <h2>Our Technology Sponsor:<br><a href="http://interfaceschool.com" target="_blank">AIM/Interface Web School</a></h2>
        <p>
          AIM is an innovative not-for-profit community organization that grows, connects and inspires the community through technology;
          and sadly, access to technology is one of the biggest barriers between students and code.
          AIM has generously donated laptops, set up with the programs needed to teach the students languages and frameworks
          we never had the technological oomph to tackle before.

        <h2>Our Graduation Sponsor:<br><a href="http://getflywheel.com" target="_blank">Flywheel</a></h2>
        <p>
           Our graduation ceremonies are a chance for students and their families to come together and celebrate all they’ve accomplished,
           and is one of our favorite parts of each class. This WordPress hosting company sponsored this fall’s graduation with snacks,
           swag, and decorations worthy of the coder’s hard work.
